[Parametric Pseudo-Manifolds](http://repository.upenn.edu/cis_reports/877/) (PPMs) are mathematical constructs that
can be used to contruct smooth approximations to data defined on a triangular mesh. Our goal was to implement PPMs
with CUDA, and use them to efficiently generate and manipulate additional detail for 3D models. 

## Overview
PPMs work by associating a smooth, local approximation of the surface to each vertex. Then, when the position
of a point P on the approximation is needed, the three nearest patches are sampled and weighted by their distance to P.

We can also perform this kind of interpolation any kind of per-vertex numerical data, such as vertex normals and
texture UV coordinates. An important consequence is that this separates geometry and topology, i.e. the structure of the approximant mesh is independent of
its vertex positions, normals, etc.

## Implementation

Since the approximations are built from data that is local to each vertex, and all patches are processed identically,
the PPM algorithm is highly parallelizable. The algorithm's outline is as follows:

* Pre-processing:
  * Build two lists of half-edges, one sorted by origin, one sorted by face.
  * Additionally, sort each set of half-edges with the same vertex in clockwise order.
  * Generate new topology (but not geometry). We subdivide each face like so: ![](img/tri_tess.png)
  * Precalculate any constant data. We use Bezier surfaces, so this includes evaluating all necessary
    polynomials at all points of interest.
